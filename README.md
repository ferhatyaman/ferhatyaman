### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- :office: I am working at AMD as Hardware Security Engineer at AMD in Advanced Security R&D team. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on lattice cryptography from cryptoanalysis of it to Post-Quantum Applications as well as Homomorphic Encryption applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning scheme transition on Homomorphic Encryption. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on applications made with Microsoft SEAL, PALISADE libraries.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding differential learning and federated learning.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about side-channel analysis and lattice-crypto  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Email [me](mailto:fyaman@ncsu.edu).
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was thinking dropping crypto course in my bachelor, right now building post-quantum crypto. :key:
